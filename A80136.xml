            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Great Queſtion In the Caſe of the ABSOLUTION OF Sir <hi>John Friend</hi> and Sir <hi>William Parkens,</hi> Which will be inſiſted on at the Trial of the Abſolvers 'tis preſum'd will be, whether the giving them <hi>Abſolution</hi> at the place of Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a Lawful, or Unlawful Act.</head>
            <p>That it was a Lawful Act, appears to me from the following Conſiderations;</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. FOR a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> to give Abſolution to a dying Penitent, if he humbly and heartily deſire it, is a lawful Act, as appears by the Rubrick in the Office for the Viſitation of the Sick; which is not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd by, but a part of the Act of Uniformity.</item>
               <item>2. There being no particular Office appointed in the Liturgy for Perſons to be Executed (whoſe Souls are as
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153870:2"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 8 -->
precious, and as much to be taken care of, as the Souls of thoſe who dye in their Beds) that for the Viſitation of the Sick, which by parity of Reaſon is farely applicable to the caſe of Perſons to be Executed, who are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd as dying Men muſt be uſed, or none at all in their Caſe; unleſs the Miniſters officiating is left to the liberty of Extemporary Effuſions, which rather become a Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtical Elder, than a Presbiter of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> And why is it not as juſtifiable to uſe the Office for the Viſitation of the Sick in the Caſe of Perſons to be Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted as to uſe the Prayer in that Office Publickly in Churches in behalf of the Sick, which are appointed by the Rubrick to be uſed in the ſick Perſons Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; for which only neceſſity, and a defect in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy is pleaded?</item>
               <item>3. The Circumſtances of time and place and Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny being entirely left by the Rubrick (where there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Command nor Prohibition concerning them) to the diſcretion and choice of the Miniſters Abſolving, and the Penitent to be Abſolved; how could it be Criminal in the Abſolvers of Sir <hi>J. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> to give them Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution with Impoſition of Hands at the place of Execution, which they deſir'd as a comfortable Support under the Terrors of Death, as a <hi>Viaticum</hi> in their Paſſage to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</item>
               <item>4. 'Tis entirely left to the Abſolving Miniſter to judge of the Spiritual ſtate of his Penitent, whether he be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified, or not, to receive Abſolution.—<hi>Vid</hi> Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>5. The Miniſters Abſolving is to reſt Satisfied with an Account of the general Repentance of the Perſon to be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153870:2"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 8 -->
Abſolved, who is not obliged to make a particular and ſpecial Confeſſion of his Sins to the Abſolver, unleſs he feel his Conſcience troubled with any weighty matter; as appears by the Rubrick, <hi>ut ſupra.</hi> To affirm the contrary, is to plead for Auricular Confeſſion, as 'tis taught and practiſed in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>6. If the Perſon to be Abſolved makes a ſpecial volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Confeſſion of his Sins, the Abſolver is bound by the Canon to conceal it, and keep it a Secret from all the World. <hi>Vid.</hi> 113. <hi>Can.</hi> If it be Objected that in caſe of a Treaſonable Conſpiracy which the Penitent confeſſes, the Abſolver is not bound to conceal it, it may be anſwer'd, that in the Caſe of Sir <hi>J. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> there was no treaſonable Conſpiracy ſo pretended or laid to their charge, but what was diſcovered and made publick, and which they were Convicted of.</item>
               <item>7. Suppoſe, that after the Death of the Abſolved Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, who dies in his Bed by the Viſitation of God, a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſhould be publiſhed under his own Hand (which the Abſolver knew nothing of) whereby it appears that he was Guilty of <hi>Hereſy</hi> in the Church, and Treaſon in the State, and that he juſtified both the one and the other: Shall this affect the Abſolver, and make him a Criminal in giving Abſolvtion? If not, then, with Submiſſion, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could the Paper left by Sir <hi>J. F.</hi> and <hi>W. P.</hi> with the Sheriff, and afterwards publiſhed, which the Abſolvers were altogether Strangers to, any ways affect the ſaid Abſolvers, or render them Criminals in giving them Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</item>
               <item>8. Suppoſe that Sir <hi>J. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> had left no Paper with the Sheriff, and none had been publiſhed after their Death; 'tis preſum'd then that the Abſolvers would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153870:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <!-- PDF PAGE 9 -->
not have been Qeſtioned, or Cenſur'd for giving them Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</item>
               <item>9. Nay farther, ſuppoſe that Sir <hi>J. F.</hi> and Sir <hi>W. P.</hi> had left a Paper with the Sheriff, which he had after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards publiſh'd, acknowledging their Guilt, and ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Repentance as to that particular Crime which they were Convicted of; then 'tis preſum'd that the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution would have been ſo far from being Cenſur'd for giving them Abſolution, that it would have bee generally agreed to be a Charitable, regular and lawful Act. And if it was in it ſelf a lawful Act at the time of the Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, no ſubſequent Act or Circumſtance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which the Abſolvers were Strangers to, would make it unlawful. Nothing could make it unlawful <hi>à parte poſt,</hi> which was a lawful Act <hi>à parte ante.</hi> But if it was in it ſelf an unlawfull Act at the time of the performance of it, no ſubſequent Act or Circumſtance whatſoever; how grateful ſoever to the Government, as in the before mention'd inſtance, could make it lawful.</item>
